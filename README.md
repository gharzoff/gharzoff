## 🚀 Projects

### ✅ Advanced Test System (Quiz Platform)

> A powerful online quiz/test system built with Django. Designed to handle complex logic with performance in mind.

#### 🧩 Features:
- Multiple-choice and open-ended questions
- Randomized question order per user
- Timer and auto-submit function
- Real-time scoring
- Admin panel for adding/editing questions
- Detailed result statistics and charts

#### ⚙️ Challenges & Solutions:
- **Problem**: Rendering hundreds of questions was slow on standard Django views.
- **Solution**: Optimized using `prefetch_related`, async JS loading, and caching for question sets.
- **Result**: Page load time decreased by **30x** compared to initial prototype.

This platform was tested with simulated traffic and performed exceptionally well under high load — making it suitable for schools and competitions.
